 - Bookmarks toolbar used now and putted above sidebar. Since it's quite short, it will be more convenient to use folders with short names and emoji instead of regular links         
 - Thin sidebar mode are removed. This mode was rather inconvenient and I didn't use it. Maybe I'll bring it back someday if someone asks for it         
 - All panels can be shown or hidden independently. Interestingly enough, I tried to implement it with various crutches for a long time, but nothing worked. It turned out that in userChrome Toggle settings it was possible to enable this functionality         

2.0 version still available [here](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/tree/2.0-old)

## Usage

### Install

#### Step 1 - Download files

 - [Download](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip theme files

#### Step 2 - Configure extensions

 - Install [Userchrome toggle Extended](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle-extended/)
   
   <details><summary>Configure Userchrome toggle Extended</summary> 
   
   <br/>

   You need to turn on "Allow multiple styles to be active together" and turn on the first four toggles. If you will be using a popup, enable "Close popup after clicking toggle" and rename the toggles for convenience. Play with the rest of the settings as you wish. Make sure you click "Apply changes" button after all
   
   ![settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44b8702d-3a92-458d-8a2e-23b8e9e5703d)

   It would also be nice to customize the shortcuts for toggles. I recommend these:
   
   ![how-to](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49948f5-4544-4070-a691-dc090f37b2d3)
   ![shortcuts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bef9f1be-878e-4103-b1a9-0d171e9850bd)
   
   <br/>
   
   </details>    


 - Install [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/sidebery)

   <details><summary>Configure Sidebery</summary> 
   
   <br/>
   
   If you used Sidebery before, it would be better to reset its settings to default.
   
   Then import `sidebery-settings.json` from unzipped theme files

   ![import](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/assets/95460152/9961a813-d035-41cc-a6b4-146e20db45bc)

   <br/>
   
   </details>    

#### Step 3 - Moving files to a profile folder

 - Find your [profile directory](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data)
 - Close Firefox
 - Move `chrome` folder and `user.js` file from unzipped theme files into your [profile directory](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data)
  
   <details><summary>Profile folder structure</summary> 
      
      <br/>

      ```js
      {random characters}.default-release // Profile folder itself
      |_ chrome // chrome folder you put in
      |  |_ userChrome.css
      |  |_ userContent.css
      |  |_ ShyFox
      |  |  |_ ... // css files
      |  |_ icons
      |  |  |_ ... // svg icons
      |  |_ wallpaper.png
      |  |_ wallpaper-light.png
      |_ user.js // user.js file you put in
      |_ ... // a lot of files that was there before
      ```

      <br/>
      
      </details>    

 - Open Firefox

#### Step 4 - Buttons layout

 - Go to the customizing page. <img src="https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/assets/95460152/49d963a3-ccb4-48f9-8892-f206894315d7"> > More tools > Customize toolbar
  
 - Move buttons to something like that:
   
   <details><summary>Customizing menu</summary>
   
   <br/>
   
   ![layout](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0524f8b-a16d-4753-bbbe-8aeccae25b2b)
   
   > NOTE                                 
   > If you don't add `Flexible Space` to the right toolbar, all buttons except `Menu` and `Extensions` will be centered on the panel
   
   <br/>
   
   </summary>

> [!NOTE]
> `System theme - auto` can cause problems in some cases
> 
> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5da52c2e-6b04-414a-b492-478a87b55f9a)



### Upgrading

 - Migrate from old version
   <details><summary>Migrate from 2.0 </summary>
   
      <br/>
      
      If you migrating from 2.0 you need delete fx-autoconfig.                     
      To do it, at first clean up `chrome` folder, at second delete `config.js` and `/defaults/prefs/config-prefs.js` from Firefox installation folder.           
      
   </details>

   <details><summary>Migrate from 3.4 </summary>
   
      <br/>
      
      If you migrating from 3.4 you need to reset Sidebery settings to default and import new ones.
         
   </details>

 - In other cases redo the installation steps 1 and 3 is enough for updating to new ShyFox version

### Customization

If you don't like the way the standard dark and light themes look, you can colorize your ShyFox!

There are three ways you can do it, choose one:
- Install some theme from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/themes/) (not all will be well compatible)
- Color your browser yourself with [Firefox Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-color/). Presets from screenshots: [pink](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAJcAQAAAAAAAABBqYhm849SCia48_6EGccwS-xMDPsqvXkIar4KdrumPOaRpoqhRtylP5n4Zfpe_3lMuBvgYbla0qT1QOs34oqRKJ__vCF6FKTI9i1CVNq28mKrlpbA743Cig4kGHR6iZLsbfXGx2TWrRs-AEYfywqkYrtkIsD-hNDUEskonC-PtUjDQO60hJRYxAdc_ciaOdJZ3qLR8-ltnNQrBrjrkZPS0cKdYESG19Ce108sPUJ-sxtRJheP8uifehJAtfT_U_CMAA), [turquoise](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAJgAQAAAAAAAABBqYhm849SCia48_6EGccwS-xMDPrv2Sw35312EPwz49WPR2-KqLVciULUNG8hT47EAt7OFG0PM9EP_FOrqm0ZcrcuiqO7AJ4ZtOtYZJYmJW2UQbLGqUwsx5a1luSAeWzbTYBr_wq9rgHinuRP90rQNt7qFSEFpoA_QEVgntqma7ntnbh1n4ffmSGvCvZINPxUCniDpGX529KAsQ3OEifjH-k0NSutAReuloDG_oDBQO0f3f3mdUhny4nuWQSUjTHVzc480xP-PnQ6), [private](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAJgAQAAAAAAAABBqYhm849SCia48_6EGccwS-xMDPsQa-obYNsLXtQH-LkSl-xiFvguLlbVAytJ7iSRZYDjI5M0HGJIVok5YY7sQJYDNqALkbhYuNd7GLBtffJP_WihaR82B9eSNM5B_AwFPXi9jAhOGSVHrux-aPHsNExZwN_G33gbtzlHrsaZ6mQVS0iF5xGMJ7hAHNnY-o-q3_nklkOvFpHlzDrKB7504aWtuHtKFi5DvcCgNYsdPEE_Pom2287flglmiD3RyZ7nv59EheVP_9zDOgA)
- Install the [Adaptive Tab Bar Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/) extension and then ShyFox will adapt to the colors of the currently open website.
 
   <details><summary> Recommended Adaptive Tab Bar Color settings</summary>  
   
   <br/>
   
   ![settings](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/assets/95460152/36480217-8209-4f7d-9d54-1a07f6f2752c)
   
   > NOTE                        
   > If you make the `Tab bar` and `Toolbar` `Background` colors the same, the pull-down hidden panels will have a transparent background.
   
   <br/>
   
   </details>

> [!NOTE]
> Use only one thing. Adaptive Tab bar Color and Firefox Color are not compatible 

You can change new tab wallpaper to your own. There is two wallpaper files in `chrome` folder:
 - `wallpaper.png` - for dark theme                   
 - `wallpaper-light.png` - for light theme             
  
To use one image for all themes just delete `wallpaper-light.png`.

You can change theme accent color. To do it change value of `--shy-accent-color` variable in `chrome/ShyFox/shy-variables.css`. You can also equate it to the fill color of the buttons. See options below

## Overview

### Panels

The browser interface has been divided into three panels:
- On left - Sidebar - Just Sidebery. Functionality of this extension is incredible. It is in charge of managing tabs and bookmarks. Above the main sidebar is a small bookmarks bar.
- On top - Navbar - panel where you can find the address bar and everything related to it
- On right - Toolbar - a panel with customizable buttons

### Toggles

The core of the theme is the [Userchrome toggle Extended](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle-extended/) extension. With the help of toggles added by it the main feature of this theme is realized.                           

| ‚Ññ | Name | Recommended shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Hide Sidebar | Ctrl + Alt + A |
| 2 | Hide Toolbar | Ctrl + Alt + D |
| 3 | Hide Navbar  | Ctrl + Alt + S |
| 4 | Clean Mode   | Ctrl + Alt + X |

Each of three panels has two states - visible and hidden. This state can be toggled independently for each panel.             

| Panel state | Image |
| :--- | --- |
| Visible | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1925a5a8-a5fc-4403-ade1-2e1949c576c5) |
| Hidden | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30c6dcab-0a4b-4a04-a29d-7cc7ad150a39) |
| Hidden (on hover) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce587abc-dea1-41d6-81bb-c8e4f5f489fe) |

The visible state is normal state, panel is just there on the screen. In hidden state panel moves out of the window border and a bar appears on the border, when hovering over it panel moves out. Note that panels in a hidden state can show useful information. The top bar will show the page load progress (not very accurate), and the right bar will show the file download progress (very accurate).

There is also a fourth toggle - Clean Mode. When Clean Mode is activated, the previous toggles are ignored and entire browser interface is hidden without any possibility to interact with it. Simply put, Clean Mode removes everything unnecessary, leaving you alone with the currently open website. Note that you can only exit it with a keyboard shortcut.                   

| Normal mode | Clean mode |
| --- | --- |
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d32db474-d0d7-4884-9296-641d07df220f) | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfcd916a-a7d3-4deb-8639-89bff00a0ada) |
| Sidebar and navbar hidden, toolbar visible. Hidden panels accesible on hover. | All panels hidden independent on previous three toggles. All panels are inaccessible. |

### Non-Sidebery mode

All tab management in ShyFox has been moved to Sidebery. And the sidebar in normal situations is completely given over to this wonderful extension. 

If the sidebar is closed, you'll see a notification with a red border saying "Open sidebar!". You should also see a red colored sidebar button somewhere. 

If sidebar is open but no Sidebery is there, the sidebar will take a slightly different shape, separating it's content from the main interface. This is where you can work with the built-in sidebars and extensions that open in the sidebar. In the sidebar header, you'll see a notification telling you that you should open Sidebery to work with tabs. If Sidebery is unavailable for some reason and you need to access tab management without it, you can find the "Enable native tabs" option in the sidebar header menu. Clicking on this item will enable the tab strip floating above the page content. In the same way you can turn it off. Native tabs are needed for emergencies, don't use this all the time.

| Default sidebar appearance | Sidebar closed | Not Sidebery oppened |

## Additional information     

 * The theme works and is only tested on the latest version of Firefox. Firefox-based browsers, ESR versions, or just older versions are not supported. It may work, but I am not responsible for it.
 * Support for macOS is limited. Theme works, but I personally can't test it there, because I don't have a mac.
