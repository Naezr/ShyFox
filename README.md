3.1.1:

3.1:           
 - Panels in the hidden state are now floating and do not touch the window edge        
 - Findbar rework        
 - If you disable bookmarks toolbar all still look fine     

3.0:
 - Navigation bar now on top. I plan to add the ability to move it down like I did in version 2.0 but I don't want to delay this update any longer     
 - Bookmarks toolbar used now and putted above sidebar. Since it's quite short, it will be more convenient to use folders with short names and emoji instead of regular links         
 - Thin sidebar mode are removed. This mode was rather inconvenient and I didn't use it. Maybe I'll bring it back someday if someone asks for it         
 - All panels can be shown or hidden independently. Interestingly enough, I tried to implement it with various crutches for a long time, but nothing worked. It turned out that in userChrome Toggle settings it was possible to enable this functionality         

2.0 version still available [here](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/tree/2.0-old)

## Install

<details><summary>Migrate from 2.0 </summary>
 
   <br/>
   
   If you migrating from 2.0 you need delete fx-autoconfig.                     
   To do it, at first clean up `chrome` folder, at second delete `config.js` and `/defaults/prefs/config-prefs.js` from Firefox installation folder.      
   
   If you new user, skip it.      
   
</details>

### Minimal

1. [Download](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) theme files
2. Install and configure [Userchrome toggle Extended](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle-extended/)
   
   <details><summary>Userchrome toggle settings</summary> 
   
   <br/>
   
   Make sure you click each "Apply changes" button, preferably several times
   
   ![settings1](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/assets/95460152/ddc7fbcb-ee97-43be-b2c9-81ff2f948ef4)
   ![settings2](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/assets/95460152/87f4f31f-183a-4643-8dc5-9c56ca8b3ba7)
   ![settings4](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/assets/95460152/e0b823db-f235-4e37-9de1-c6a7d30def2a)

   It would also be nice to customize the shortcuts for toggles. I recommend these:

   <br/>
   
   </details>    
   
3. Install and configure [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery)
 
    Import `sidebery/sidebery-data.json` into Sidebery (Sidebery settings > help > import addon data).                 
    When updating Sidebery style, it is better to insert it from `sidebery-style.css` file manually. (Sidebery settings > Style editor)
    
    > NOTES
    > 
    > When importing styles from json, Sidebery does not delete the old style,but inserts the new one after the old one.
    > So if you have used Sidebery before, reset the extension's settings to default, making a backup before doing so.
    > 
    > In general, you can use any style for Sidebery, not necessarily the one that comes with ShyFox.
    > But I'm not responsible for how it will fit together.        

4. Close Firefox and then put `chrome` folder, and `user.js` into your [profile directory](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data).
5. Launch Firefox and open Sidebery in the sidebar. To do this, click on the Sidebery icon. It's most likely in the extensions menu.
6. Go to the customizing page (menu button > more tools > customize toolbar) and move buttons to something like that

   ![layout](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/assets/95460152/ea349f5c-bfc4-4af0-bd55-4715d7bf6755)
   
   > NOTE                                 
   > If you don't add `Flexible Space` to the right toolbar, all buttons except `Menu` and `Extensions` will be centered on the panel
   
   <br/>
   
   </summary>

### Extra

If you don't like the way the standard dark and light themes look, you can colorize your ShyFox!

There are three ways you can do it, choose one:
- Install some theme from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/themes/) (not all will be well compatible)
- Color your browser yourself with [Firefox Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-color/)
- Install the [Adaptive Tab Bar Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/) extension and then ShyFox will adapt to the colors of the currently open website.
 
   <details><summary> Recommended Adaptive Tab Bar Color settings</summary>  
   
   <br/>
   
   ![settings](https://github.com/Naezr/ShyFox/assets/95460152/36480217-8209-4f7d-9d54-1a07f6f2752c)
   
   > NOTE                    
   > If you make the `Tab bar` and `Toolbar` `Background` colors the same, the pull-down hidden panels will have a transparent background.
   
   <br/>
   
   </details>

If you don't like the wallpaper on the new tab, you can change it to your own. Just rename your picture to `wallpaper.png` and put in into `chrome` folder. There's also `wallpaper-alt.png` - same picture, but in the daytime.

You can disable floating search bar. To do it go to the `userChrome.css` file and comment line that imports `shy-floating-search.css`.

You can change browser accent color. To do it change value of `--shy-color` variable in `ShyFox/shy-variables.css`, `userContent.css` and in Sidebery style.

## Additional information     

 * The theme works and is only tested on the latest version of Firefox. Firefox-based browsers, ESR versions, or just older versions are not supported. It may work, but I am not responsible for it.
 * I don't know if this theme works on macOS. I don't have a mac to test it. I have made the control buttons work on both left and right (thanks Linux and GTK), but I can't test this on mac.

## Features

### Panels

The browser interface has been divided into three panels:
- On left - Sidebar - Just Sideberry. Functionality of this extension is incredible. It is in charge of managing tabs and bookmarks. Above the main sidebar is a small bookmarks bar.
- On top - Navbar - panel where you can find the address bar and everything related to it
- On right - Toolbar - a panel with customizable buttons

### Toggles

The core of the theme is the [Userchrome toggle Extended](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle-extended/) extension. With the help of toggles added by it the main feature of this theme is realized.                            

Each of three panels has two states - visible and hidden. This state can be toggled independently for each panel.             

The visible state is normal state, panel is just there on the screen.                   

In hidden state panel moves out of the window border and a bar appears on the border, when hovering over it panel moves out. The first three toggles are responsible for this case.                      

There is also a fourth toggle - Clean Mode. When Clean Mode is activated, the previous toggles are ignored and entire browser interface is hidden without any possibility to interact with it. Simply put, Clean Mode removes everything unnecessary, leaving you alone with the currently open website. Note that you can only exit it with a keyboard shortcut.                   

| № | Name | Recommended shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Hide Sidebar | Ctrl + Alt + A |
| 2 | Hide Toolbar | Ctrl + Alt + D |
| 3 | Hide Navbar  | Ctrl + Alt + S |
| 4 | Clean Mode   | Ctrl + Alt + X |

## To-Do

 * Make the background colors less flat, add a glow, a blur or something like that (almost impossible because Sidebery cannot be transparent)
 * Add icons to menubar and context menu
 * Add navbar on bottom support
 * Make it clearer when a window is in focus and when it is not
